Readme

Configurations are in the Readme.pdf.
Readme.pdf also includes a brief instruction.
My application uses plenty of UI, so I put content of readme in a .pdf file to add some screen shots.

In the 1.1 version:
    I put camera task into a new thread.
    I disable the "take picture" button by making it invisible.
    If the camera fail to work, the data will not be stored into database so no data with empty image.
